 * The registration token represents a combination of the users device id, the

 * the same mechanism by which a sender can directly address a users devices
 * via the GCM network.
 *
 * Refresh can occur for a number of reasons:
 *
 * <li>Periodically (every 6 months)</li>
 * <li>If there are security issues (SSL failure)</li>
